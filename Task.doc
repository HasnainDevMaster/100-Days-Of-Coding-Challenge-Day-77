100 Days Of Coding Challenge!

Day-77 Task:
Read and understand the following Visual Guide about SSL, TLS, and SSH protocols.

SSL vs TLS vs SSH Protocols https://roadmap.sh/guides/ssl-tls-https-ssh

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):

* Overview: SSL is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure communications over a network.
It was widely used in web browsers and servers to protect data transmission.

* How It Works: SSL encrypts the data between the client (like a browser) and the server.
This prevents third parties from reading or altering the data being transferred.

* History: SSL was replaced by TLS due to vulnerabilities,
but the term "SSL" is still used colloquially to refer to this kind of security protocol.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. TLS (Transport Layer Security):

* Overview: TLS is the successor to SSL and is more secure.
It is the modern standard for encrypting network communications, especially in HTTPS,
emails, and other protocols.

* TLS Handshake: When a connection is established,
TLS uses a process called the "TLS handshake" to authenticate the communicating parties,
agree on encryption methods, and exchange encryption keys securely.

* Versions: TLS has had multiple versions to address security flaws and improve functionality.
The most widely used versions are TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. SSH (Secure Shell):

* Overview: SSH is a network protocol used for securely accessing and managing remote servers over an unsecured network.
It provides a secure channel for tasks such as logging into a server, executing commands, and transferring files.

* SSH Authentication: SSH uses public key cryptography for authentication.
The server has a public key, and the client must authenticate using a private key or password.

* Usage: It is commonly used for secure system administration, file transfers via SFTP, and tunneling.

Differences:

* SSL vs TLS: TLS is the newer, more secure protocol that replaces SSL.
While SSL is now considered obsolete, people still often refer to TLS as "SSL" informally.

* TLS vs SSH: TLS is used mainly for encrypting web-based communication (such as HTTPS),
while SSH is used for secure system administration and file transfers over a network.
